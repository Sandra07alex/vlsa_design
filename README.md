# vlsa_design
## This is  the set of project done inorder to study VLSA ,which is done through Five Day Hands-on Workshop on VLSI Design conducted by IIT PALAKAD

## 1.EDGE DECTECTOR
### An edge detector is a circuit or algorithm designed to identify changes or boundaries in a signal or image. In VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) design, edge detectors are commonly implemented as part of image processing systems, communication devices, or other signal processing applications. The primary function of an edge detector is to detect significant changes in signal intensity, which often correspond to the edges or boundaries of objects within an image or signal.

## 2.FIBONOGEN
### A Fibonacci series generator in VLSI design is a digital circuit or module that generates numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1.
## 1.RIPPLE CARRY ADDER
### A ripple carry adder is a basic digital adder circuit used in VLSI design to perform binary addition. It adds two binary numbers along with a carry-in bit to produce a sum and a carry-out bit.
## 1.SERIAL ADDER
### A serial adder is a type of digital adder that performs binary addition bit-by-bit in a sequential manner. Unlike parallel adders, which add all bits simultaneously, serial adders process one bit at a time.
